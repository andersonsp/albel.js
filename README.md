albel.js
========

The ultimate JS web framework

Albel JS is designed to incorporate the latest ideas in client side application development
Written on top of Backbone.js borrowing some Ideas from Addy Osmany's Aura.js and Katz's Ember.js.

Right now Albel.js is under heavy development and extremely unstable.
